## Prebuilt vignettes

Vignettes that require INLA cannot be built on the automated packaging sites
like r-universe and CRAN.  Place such vignettes in the `vignettes_prebuild/`
folder instead.  Every time you do changes that should be propagated to the package
website and/or the package itself, run
```{r,eval=FALSE}
source("vignettes/prebuild.R")
```
and then commit the generated files.

Make sure you do not edit the generated files manually; always edit the `.Rmd`
files in `vignettes/prebuild/`, and not the generated version in `vignettes/`.

Also keep in mind that generated figures may take a substantial amount of space, so
you should only regenerate the vignettes when necessary.

## git flow branching

"gitflow" is a convention for branching structure, that can be used fully, or just with the
basics. The simplest use is to have a "devel" branch where day-to-day updates are made,
and a "stable" branch (for `dirinla` this is the "master" branch) where the stable
versions are kept.  That way, users can choose whether they want the latest stable
version, or if they need/want to try the lastest development features (while taking the risk
of there being new bugs!).
While preparing a new stable release, a temporary "release branch" is created for setting
u the new release and doing final testing.

See these [Git Flow instructions](https://skoch.github.io/Git-Workflow/) for
how to install the git flow components on your computer.
Then got to the `dirinla` directory and run
```
git flow init
```
Set the "production releases" branch to `master`, and the "integration of the next release"
branch to `devel`, and use the default values for the rest.

Then work on the `devel` branch for regular updates to the code and vignettes.
When pushed to github, the githubio pages will be updated based on the contents
of the `devel` branch.

When you're ready to make a new stable release, follow the checklist below.

## Stable release checklist

This is a simplified version of the `inlabru` [release check-list](https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabru/issues/139)
(it skips the CRAN steps and some of the extensive testing steps).

On the `devel` branch, package versions take the form `x.y.z.devel`.
On the `master` branch, package versions take the form `x.y.z`.
Before preparing a release, check what the `x.y.z.devel` version is; the new stable release
should be either

* `x.y.(z+1)` for "patch/bugfix" releases,
* `x.(y+1).0` for "minor" releases, that e.g. introduce significant new features, or
* `(x+1).0.0` for "major" releases, that e.g. change the interface in a non-backwards compatible way.

The most common releases are patch and minor releases.

This versioning scheme ensures that one can always know if someone is using a
stable release or a development version.  If one also uses `use_version("dev")`
regularly on the development branch, further detail is preserved by incrementing the `.devel`
part of the development version number.

Prepare for release:

* [ ] [Polish NEWS](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html#news-release)
* [ ] `devtools::build_readme()`
* [ ] [`urlchecker::url_check()`](https://github.com/r-lib/urlchecker)
* [ ] `git flow release start x.y.z` (replace `x.y.z` with the actual new version)
* [ ] `usethis::use_version()` (this updates the `x.y.z` part of the version
       to one you can choose from a list,
       and removes the `.devel` part from `x.y.z.devel`)
* [ ] Push to github for checking; `git flow release publish x.y.z`
* [ ] `devtools::check(remote = TRUE, manual = TRUE)`
* If everything is ok, continue, otherwise fix the problems and check again
* [ ] `git flow release finish x.y.z`
* [ ] `usethis::use_dev_version()`, commit & push
* [ ] `git checkout master`
* [ ] `git push`
* [ ] `git push --tags`
* [ ] `usethis::use_github_release()`, then edit and approve the release on github
* [ ] Tweet (or let people know about the new release in some other way)

You can copy the check-list code into a github Issue, like the [inlabru release issue](https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabru/issues/139).
